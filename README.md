# Heart-Disease-Prediction-and-severity-Categorisation

The WHO states that cardiovascular diseases are one of the most prevalent causes of
death globally and a large number of people die due to this disease every year.
Cardiovascular diseases include deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial disease,
coronary heart disease, congenital heart disease and rheumatic heart disease. 31% of the
death of people is due to Heart disease around the globe every year.

We have tried to perform prediction as well as severity categorisation of heart disease .
Prior diagonosis of heart disease can prove to be very beneficial as well as life saving 
for many patients.

For the disease prediction states, there are five indices which indicate the presence or severity of heart disease.
For state ,
  0: No presence of heart disease or absence of disease
  1: presence with a low severity
  2: presence with a medium severity
  3: presence with a fatal severity
  4: presence with a absolutely fatal severity
  
There are five algorithms used by us for the purpose of disease prediction and categorisation.
The accuracies obtained for each are listed below:

> KNN: 58.67
> ANN: 70.8
> Naive Bayes: 61.53
> SVM: 67.21
> Random Forest: 62.24
